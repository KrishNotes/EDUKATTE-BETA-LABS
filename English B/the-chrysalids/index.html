<p>Chapter 1</p>
<p>The society is oriented around what can be referred to as pseudo (something false) commandant which are created by man rather that being strict biblical law. So we are justified in saying, the society interprets the bible in ways that allow them to control the members of the society. Those who are the leaders are making these to docile (take over). To make rules for people to fear &amp; keep them in check. David was taught a certain precept (a basic unchangeable ideology) about his society. These precepts seek to condemn everything that was different or unusual. Labelling all that was different as monstrosity. These precepts encourage members of the society to always b n the look out for anything that was different. To be fearful and to also reject anything that didn't conform to &quot;the norm&quot; . The bible is being misused and twisted. Those who lead the society is to separate people who are different. The story is based on a misuse of the bible. It's not the 1st time.</p>
<p>Sophie's characterization a poet/writer etc. will give certain qualities or traits to a character in order to achieve his objective. It is achieved in 3 different ways; giving action, words &amp; what others say about the character. Through these 3 mechanisms in which the audience creates a judgement on the character. A poet/writer uses this in order to manipulate the mind of the audience because by doing this, he will be able to effectively communicate his intentions i.e. to achieve the writer's purpose.</p>
<p>Through characterization a writer is able to guide the emotional responses from his audience. Language is a very potent tool as through language a writer is able to communicate his ideology and philosophy. Whyndam is continuing that Sophie has to live in fear of being exposed but he continues &quot;if anyone was to find out they'd be terribly unkind to her&quot;. We also become fearful for Sophie because she is a pretty child that has a defect that people will hurt her for.</p>
<p>David goes home and begins to remember the aspects of men that was taught to him. The society wants him to think anybody who is different is hateful to god. Religion is being used in the society as an agent of division, persecution (to be chased, placed in a position of fear, hunted). We may have defects &amp; to others it may be strange. In this society of Waknuk there is an attempt to hold on o the old ways of man which in itself is self-defeating, and it is not possible cause deviations is happening anyways.</p>
<p>Chapter 2</p>
<p>David (our narrator) describes what he had learned and what he judged his grandfather. We learnt Elias was a stern man, evangelic fire (he emphasized the word of god). Elias Strorm was not a man to compromise in any way. We are also told he took on a wife, she was beautiful but Elias' harsh ways soon made her into an old woman. Because of his ways it became overbearing. David's father becomes as overbearing as his father (Elias) he always influenced by Nicholson's Repentances. Joseph Strorm held status and authority in the Waknuk society. We learn he was a self appointed and head strong man.. Joseph takes the privilege of interpreting what god had in mind. Here we are presented with an over zealous religion leader. Our zealousness of any kind is always counter productive and self-defeating. These inscriptions on the walls emphasized the sternness with which Waknuk society is regulated. In a way we can also state that these become authoritative pseudo - commandments. It shows you that this society has re-interpreted and redefined the bible for their own objectives. It is fair to say Joseph is purposely misinterpreting biblical text as a means of ontrolling the society.</p>
<p>Chapter 3</p>
<p>Previously David suggested while he learned the precepts of his society, he was unable to see Sophie as anything other than an innocent child. Even though Waknuk society tries to emphasis that anything abnormal was the work of the devil and should be treated with utmost rejection. The society is rigidly controlled and the bible/scripture is twisted in order to maintain rigid controll.</p>
<p>Joseph is said to have a keen eye for offenses. It means he is zealous (eager) in his effort to eliminate anything that he perceives to be be abnormal. It can be said that he is a man with little compassion for even the slightest abnormality. <em>Offenses were plants</em>.</p>
<p>These appear to be certain zones, places like Waknuk and wild country then fringes are populated exclusively by deviational human beings. We must see that those who live in the fringes are alienated (pushed out) from civilized society. The irony is that a civilized society will not reject members of the society. It is the same context in the world like racism or religion. They are treated differently. How can it be civilized if it treats others so harshly and differently.</p>
<p>Chapter 4</p>
<p>Importantly Whyndan is presenting to us David's interaction with his own family and Sophie's family, the Wenders. What is of note is the difference in the treatment he receives. There is a sense of persistent tension at his own home, whereas he is genuinely more comfortable with the Wenders. This illustrates contrast. We can infer that the nature of the family is quite different. The Wenders illustrate lenient acceptance, whereas the Strorms show rigid tolerance.</p>
<p>This incident where David injures himself becomes clear evidence of stern intolerance with which Joseph Strorm deals with anything that goes against his beliefs. David innocently thought aloud something whimsical (fanciful, without basis). However this is treated as a grave offense to the laws of god. David is ruthlessly punished later that night. Empathy, where we can understand the situation faced by another person. We empathize with David cause we know he meant nothing bad. But that fact his father became so aggressive allows us to see hoe intolerant Joseph Strorm really is.</p>
<p>This incident also causes David to become even more aware of the terrible danger Sophie can be faced with. This dream that David experiences after being punished becomes an element of fore shadowing ( a writer provides hints of what is to come in the story).David's punishment for such a simple thing as a thought causes extreme response, so the reader also begins to wonder what might happen to Sophie who has an extra toe. So David' dream creates anxiety in the reader's mind. We understand David's anxiety (a level of empathy).</p>
<p>Chapter 5</p>
<p>The Alan Erving incident, apart from creating a crisis for Sophie's secret also allows the reader to better understand Waknuk society. Empathy becomes a strategy for audience reaction. The audience will feel Sophie's fear. This incident becomes significant. Alan is entirely submerged into the ideals of the society. It becomes an interesting contrast; David: questioning the society, Alan: blind follower. Story based on interpretation/misinterpretation of the biblical law. Love was driving force of the biblical law, but it is tout by using how the society is to gain control. David's action of trying to defend his friend illustrates a selfless effort to defend someone he loves. In his mind Sophie is a decent, normal, little girl who is not a monster that the society would make her out to be. David already recognizes the treat brought on her by Alan so when he fights Alan he is also fighting against the precepts of his society.</p>
<p>The Wenders recognized that by hiding Sophie's 6th toe, they are breaking the law. Marie &amp; John always kept an escape in a state of readiness. The Wenders acknowledge the pre-occupation. It infers that the society is ridged and even brutal. They live in fear because of the malignant &amp; intolerant practices of Waknuk. They are constantly waiting for the catalyst/pivot.</p>
<p>Sophie's mother had some small ability of telepathy communication. Mrs. Wenders' ability to communicate indicates that evolutionary telepathic can transmit but can't receive, the process of ongoing, the compare &amp; contrast that is presented, indicates that change cannot be stopped, as Mrs. Wenders is older. Whyndam is criticizing that seizing change cannot be stopped.</p>
<p>David returns home and Alan has disclosed all he information. John requested that David stay in their house to allow then more escape time, David selflessly agrees to it. This shows a high level of bravery but also courage inspired by love. David sacrifices, every sound provokes terror. Self sacrifice for his friend.</p>
<p>This is a very emotional charged chapter, where David knowingly lies to conceal the truth about his friend. David has put through a thorough interrogation (a very rough/serious interview) by his father &amp; the inspector. The inspector is more kindly &amp; patient in his approach where as Joseph is full of wrath &amp; allegation. Joseph then proceeds to beat the truth out of David. The after effect are only described where David couldn't lie on his back, but the reader could only imagine through inferencing (fill the blanks) the awful beating which David must have endured.</p>
<p>At the end of Chapter 5 David pathetically (pitiable) laments (sorry about something) that he could not help but divulge the full story of Sophie. He is not pleased or happy about it.</p>
<p>The reader is filled with pity and admiration for David's character. While he does tell he tried as hard and took as much as he could. What David endures becomes characterization of him because we get to better understand and see the character of David. We gat another picture of Joseph, violent &amp; impatient. Joseph's character becomes malignant (evil, wicked) while David's character is heroic. Characterization brings an audience reaction (emotional &amp; psychological).</p>
<p>Chapter 6</p>
<p>David after interacting with Sophie comes to realize that the precepts of Waknuk society as it regards it Deviations, Blasphemies, Mutants are wrong. While the society proposed that everyone like Sophie was a monstrosity &amp; hateful insight of god, that is not so at all, therefore within the group of telepaths they begin to question the workings of their society. This is a critical evaluation of how Waknuk society works. Where they question things they have been taught &amp; told. There is double edge irony, they are mutants talking about the unfairness.</p>
<p>The discussion that takes place between David &amp; the inspector allows the audience to better evaluate the small minded, dogmatic views of those who control the society. The discussion among the telepaths where they evaluate the precepts of the society also becomes the 1st time where they collectively realize the dangers they themselves will face in Waknuk. This brings them together as they share the same problems.</p>
<p>Uncle Axel's evaluation of his distant travels are astonishing &amp; interestingly particularly about the things he saw. One thing that must be remark though is what he says with regards to how things flourish in certain places. Axel points out that if things were indeed against god's will then why did they seem to prosper so well. This view presented by Uncle Axel becomes an echo of David's evaluation of Sophie. So from an ideological point of view, there is a similarity between David's criticism of the precepts of the society and Uncle Axel i.e. they are beginning the question if the rules &amp; regulations are correct.</p>
<p>We can see that everything that occurs naturally is explained in a religious perspective &amp; the intention of these explanations is to instill fear &amp; control the population by those who use religion as authority. We can see the backward &amp; unscientific nature of these explanations. Martha who attempts to rationally explain the natural nature of the landscape tends to be ridiculed because his explanations threaten the authority of the religion. They are very fearful to the challenges of their power.</p>
<p>Chapter 7</p>
<p>There is going to be a new baby, but observe that the society is so rigidly occupied with normalcy and certification that even though the child is physically there, there will be no admission of the child unless it reaches a certification. We see the deep level of pretense that influences the decision of this society. It also raises, so what if the child doesn't meet the approval of the inspector. We learn more from Aunt Harriet.</p>
<p>The child just disappears and no one acknowledges the fact there was a child &amp; is very interesting. It makes the reader make an informed judgement about a callousness of a society. The irony is clear, the society pretends to uphold biblical view when the truth is that its blinded by its own arrogance.</p>
<p>The situation presented, is a very emotionally charged &amp; sensitive one, where Aunt Harriet's child is clearly deviational &amp; has come to her sister, Emily with a crazy &amp; desperate idea of borrowing baby Petra to make a switch. The idea may be silly to us but what we must observe is the desperation of a mother hoping to save her child at any cost. There is an irony, we are told that having produced 2 babies on 2 occasions, didn't receive certification, that she herself produced deviational children yet have the audacity (bold-faceness) to call Harriet's body a monster when she created two. The indignant hypocrisy of the society must be observed as well as, that Emily has no sympathy, humanity, or mercy to show to her sister. We must imagine the desperation of Harriet &amp; we are moved by the emotional gravity of what she's doing. We will learn that after 3 pregnancies &amp; 3 deviational children is deemed useless. If you can't make normal children you will be discarded. All of this paints the society in a very cruel, heartless and non feeling light.</p>
<p>Joseph is laying blame on Harriet for producing a mockery of a human being. The irony is that his own wife also produced deviations. The hypocrisy of the society is tremendous. Very interesting. Joseph illustrates his self riotousness. Joseph blames Harriet &amp; chastises her about her sin. In truth, what Harriet was attempting was out of desperation. Joseph sees it as the manipulation of the laws of god.</p>
<p>Joseph now takes it as a personal responsibility that Harriet understands her sin. It ends with Harriet's body found drowned in a river. The circumstances were mysterious. Whyndam has created certain context clues for us to read between the lines. It may seem that death was not accidental and we may suggest that Joseph had something to do with her death.</p>
<p>Chapter 8</p>
<p>In the beginning David reflects on the episode of Harriet and this memory impacts him deeply because this makes him very aware of the extent to which this society will pursue anything that is different. It is implied by characterization of the character of Joseph Strorm. This information allows us to see who Joseph is.</p>
<p>We also see in chapter 7 what Joseph tells Emily that she cannot born a mutant. It is also implied that Joseph is a murderer. David imagines what happened to aunt Harriet &amp; her baby and is driven to the point of desperate prayer so that he may become normal. This desperation is also catalyzed by fear as he sees, knows &amp; understands what happens to people with different physical appearances. For David to reach the point of desperate prayers, the reader can empathize with his emotional turmoil (confusion) as he is desperate &amp; afraid.</p>
<p>What Axel says is interesting. He is remarking upon what he sees to be a significant error in Waknuk society today. He points out that they are trying to get back to the status of the old people but the old people destroyed themselves. Axel is saying that they are also going to repeat the same mistake that the old people did i.e. the old people destroyed themselves and they will also do so. We see the people in this society who think they are superior are in fact repeating the mistake of the old people.</p>
<p>Clearly Axel's way of thinking differ significantly from the rest of society. He is more open minded but also more logical &amp; pragmatic (practical) than the rest of society who adhere to archaic dogmatic principles. Quite sensible Axel evaluates that unique qualities in man that elevates him above all other animals &amp; rationalizes that any advancement of mind is an advancement of man. While he is not saying it directly, Axel is putting forward that David, Rosalind &amp; others are actually the next step forward in human evolution.</p>
<p>Chapter 9</p>
<p>A startling new discovery is made among the telepaths, Petra has an amazing potency in her ability. The intro to Petra complicates the plot quite considerably, what is outstanding about her is that she can command rather than merely communicate. Within the framework of of what Axel proposed quite logically. Petra is another forward step in the evolutionary process of man's mental ability. Importantly, Petra's discovery also creates another level of vulnerability for the telepaths and as the plot evolves, Petra's role will assume critical importance.</p>
<p>The interlude with old Jacob illustrates the puritanical zeal (self riotousness) and dogmatism that characterizes the society. Old Jacob's recollection also recalls the treatment directed to deviational humans &amp; is nothing short of barbaric where women were wiped and sowed while deviational humans were burned at the stake. Old Jacob's recollection are important as they serve to make David hyperalert of the precariousness of the group's existence &amp; secret, emphasizing how important it is to continue their own concealment. We come across Petra which brings across worry and vulnerability to the group of telepaths.</p>
