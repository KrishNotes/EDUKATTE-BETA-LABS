<p>Shakespeare's Dramatic Art</p>
<p>Shakespeare wrote during the Elizabeth era of English history and many issues and situations he spoke of were directly relevant to his society. However what makes Shakespeare such a great and timeless dramatist is primarily because what he writes about is universal and they reflect the challenges that constantly face human society and interactions. MV falls into the genre of comedy which is specifically humorous, however Shakespeare's comedy also becomes a vehicle like which Shakespeare addresses very serious issues in his society.</p>
<p>He also deals with issues that are often times serious, contentious to the society. In MV Shakespeare incorporates various thematic elements, among the more potent, thematic areas that he addresses are issues of friendship, brotherhood, romantic love, but for more powerful than these, Shakespeare addresses issues of religion, hatred, greed &amp; jealousy and also with many of his other plays, Shakespeare addresses the concept of forgiveness.</p>
<p>In the play there are also issues dealing with women's place in society &amp; even the law.</p>
<p>ACT ONE, SCENE I</p>
<p>‣</p>
<p>Stage directions</p>
<p>Serve numerous functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>provides stage setting, props, background</li>
<li>let us know direction of the racter</li>
<li>gives us ongoing action where curtains are raised</li>
<li>Also give emotional context for characters</li>
<li>to be used in producing the play</li>
</ol>
<p>The play opens with Antonio remarking upon his state of melancholy and it confuses him because he says he does not know how he came by it. Antonio is sad and uncertain why. Salerio and Salanio we would learn are close friend of Antonio and Bassanio but very importantly they are there to lend support to Antonio as he is sad. Salerio is suggesting that Antonio's mind may be troubled if his merchandise was on the sea. He would look at anything that would comfort him. These friends are trying to relieve the fears of Antonio. Right away Shakespeare is introducing to us one of the primary themes that will feature in this play. We would like to say that friendship is a very admirable part of love. Because care is love &amp; indeed this theme of friendship is best exemplified in the relationship between Antonio &amp; Bassanio. The word friendship has no bound and may even be referred to as brotherhood where 1 person is willing to sacrifice himself for the wellbeing of his brother/friend.</p>
<p>Shakespeare sees friendship as an almost Devine sort of love</p>
<p>Antonio's actions would have echoed or reflected those of Christ.</p>
<p>Note #2</p>
<p>Salanio &amp; Salerio are friends to Bassanio. But they both know Bassanio &amp; Antonio are best friends. They both share unique relationships that can be taken as brotherhood. These few men Salerio, Salanio, Lorenzo, Antonio, Bassanio &amp; Gratiano. We see Bassanio and Antonio is very special. The play opened where Antonio was very sad &amp; all of them were trying to chare him up, but he remained melancholy until Bassanio arrives. This change in mod becomes evidence of the depth of the relationship they share. There has been a previous discussion between Antonio &amp; Bassano with regard to a special lady.</p>
<p>This is because they both share a special bond. They trust each other. This revelations becomes another example of the close bond they share. We learn certain elements of characterization, Antonio is the chief lender to Bassanio (he is in debt to Antonio) he is a money waster. Refers to himself as something prodigal. He admits that he owes Antonio the greatest debt of love as well as $. We can 1 Bassanio looks to Antonio for help and support and Antonio is always willing to give on support his friend. Throughout this part Shakespeare is willing to make us see the close relationship, loyalty and friendship of the two men. Also here Bassanio has come up with a scheme to repay his debt to Antonio. Antonio says his person/ physical self by unlock to his desire. He has pledged his loyalty support to whatever the plan is. Bassanio is saying he is entering a risk, he enters an analogy. Lending him money will get him the one he loves and everything he owes.</p>
<p>Note #3</p>
<p>Bassanio just came forward and asked for a loan. Antonio does not hesitate to offer his assistance to Bassanio in any way. Their level of selfless generosity that Antonio shows to his friend Bassanio. We learn of a rich, beautiful woman, Portia, who lives in another part of Venice, Belmont. Right now suitors (gentlemen interested in Portia) seeking Portia’s hand in marriage and Bassanio would also like to win Portia. But in order to do that he has to have certain finances. Bassanio needs finances in order to even approach Portia.</p>
<p>Antonio suggests that all of his wealth is tide up at sea (his merchandise is in transport). Even though Antonio does not have disposable wealth he does not reject Bassanio’s plea. Instead, and two now makes a proposal that they seek credit, i.e. they will now borrow the money, Bassanio may need. This is the problem they face, therefore it is because of Antonio’s love for Bassanio that they will have to turn to shylock (the Jewish) the moneylender. Shakespeare, is well aware of the socio cultural stigma (stereo type) associated with Jewish/ Christian antagonism (tension). But Antonio’s love for Bassanio is so deep and great that he will be willing to borrow the money even from his enemy to ensure his friends success</p>
<p>Note #4</p>
<p>It opens with Launcelot Gobbo (servant to shylock) questioning himself whether to work for the Jew or leave his service. In this soliloquy (monologue) Launcelot presents his mental arguments to the audience. It offers us an opportunity to hear a character thinking aloud. A soliloquy allows the audience to understand the deeper workings of the characters mind. This does two things, one it helps to communicate the plot structure of the play and two to make the character more realistic. Launcelot is experiencing two minds of something. The irony is that it calls his conscience hard and decides to leave his service. Throughout the play, several characters past verbal judgment of shylock (Antonio and Launcelot and more in the future). We recall that characterization is achieved in five ways every character sees shylock as pessimistic. As the play progresses, we get more evidence, that proves shylock as a truly wretched human being and as such the audience also come to judge shylock because of what he does what he says on what others say about him.</p>
<p>Old gobo is blind so he is unaware that he is talking to his own son, which gives the opportunity of dramatic irony, where the audience is aware of certain things the person on stage doesn’t. Dramatic irony fulfills a few functions. It’s complicates the plot, is a technique used to reveal information, allows us to understand deception in the play, used to create humor or comedy as used in most Shakespeare plays because of the mistaken identity presented.</p>
<p>In this play Shakespeare presents us with two parent child relationships that are actual, old Gobbo, young Gobbo, shylock and Jessica and another which no longer exists, is still active. He also presents us with a parent that died with Portia and her dead father. By presenting numerous parent child relationships, as part of the plot and subplot. By presenting numerous relationships, Shakespeare is allowing the audience an opportunity to compare and contrast and therefore judge characters even further. We remember that Portia’s father left clues for her when Portia is to be married. He left a test for her husband. Later on, we will see that Jessica runs away from shylock and also steals from her father. When shylock discovers the theft, he is more concerned of the loss of his wealth rather than his child. By presenting these two relationships is giving us an opportunity to compare and contrast and make judgment that shylock was more concerned of his material compared to Portia’s father who cares for her.</p>
<p>Act two scene II</p>
<p>Launcelot told us he will try confusion with him, in line 39 to 32, the instructions of very confusing. It’s intended to confuse. Young Launcelot purposely deceived his father, perhaps because his father was absent from his life all along. Anyway Launcelot is being purposely unkind. The father, Google upon hearing this news, responds with an old boost of disbelief, the father is a Spanish, shocked and indult hoot at the same time. Even beyond the grave Portia’s father wanted the best for her with a test for her husband. Global does not know upon hearing his son’s death so immediate grief. However, when Jessica runs away from shylock’s house, is only consideration is for the loss of his wealth, he does not care about her. Shakespeare allows us to recognize the parental care and concern illustrated in the different parent child relationships. It becomes a part of the implied characterization. Launcelot refers to old Gobbo many times as father and the father, Gobbo thinks nothing of it. The pronoun of Launcelot calling him father becomes an ironic pun. Double entendre (instead of two different meanings). He calls him father for respect and because he is his father.</p>
<p>What Launcelot says is important. He tells his father the truth and comes clean. The different use of pronouns, boy, son, child. As the pronouns change, the depth of emotional connection changes. Launcelot was abandoned and is willing to be his child. The emotional gravity must be evaluated and taken in context that when Jessica runs away he effectively disowns and curses her, he was more concerned of wealth than his own child. Additionally, Launcelot is willing to forgive his father as his father’s child. Shakespeare di become recognized because he wasn’t known but that every word is and yields tremendous insight and meaning.</p>
<p>Launcelot a boys and shares his plan to leave the Jew and work for Bassanio and give the gift for the Jew to Bassanio. Old global with his blind self seeks to intervene for his son to have a better life. Launcelot and Portia’s fathers both want the best for their child.</p>
<p>Note #6</p>
<p>In act 2 scene 2 line 80, Bassanio is cautioning Gratiano to be nicer. Bassanio wants to make a good impression on Portia, he first of all approach Antonio for money to be in noble manner. He take into service a worker, Launcelot and cautions his friends. Bassanio ensures that a prerequisites (something you have beforehand) are done. He is attaching emphasis.</p>
<p>From the introduction of shylock’s daughter, Jessica. The audience is made aware of her feelings of living in shylock home and there’s a tremendous sense of unhappiness. She uses hell, tedious, also in scene three we learn something important. Jessica is conducting a secret relationship with Lorenzo, a Christian which will be seen by shylock as the deepest betrayal more than the theft of his money. Shakespeare is directing toward Jews. It might not be favorable, but hatred is the ideology of Shakespeare. He is writing to please audience. The relationship between Jessica and shylock, just from the words hell and tedious we can gage that the relationship is not a good one. Shakespeare has three parent child relationships. Two Christians and one Jew. We see that the Jew cares more for the money than his child.</p>
<p>We point to something further. Jessica admits she is a Jew by blood but she has little in common with her father. Shakespeare is presenting the Jewish in a contemptuous manner. Why would Jessica leave her father and Jewalism? There is the push factor that is she is discontented living this life with her father. Lorenzo is the push factor.</p>
<p>We learn that that very night masque (speaks of a costume party). The masque becomes dramatically important in two ways, a part of the plot structure and allows Jessica’s escape from shylock’s house. Jessica uses this night of the masque to change her own identity as she shifts from Jew to Christian. The masque is used as a pun while it’s a carnival it changes one’s identity. We remember that in order to finalize the loan, they have a dinner meeting. While the Christians loath the Jews the Christians also loath. Therefore when shylock makes an absolute bond/ contract, it is still influenced by his hatred towards the Christians. The reader will see shylock as a sly and wretched person. In scene six we see the masque is in progress. Lorenzo has come to steal Jessica. She steals a casket full of jewels and throws it down to him. She goes to get more ducats. Jessica does not lament her decision at all. It is part of the attempt that Shakespeare incorporates directed to Jews.</p>
<p>Act II - Scene VII</p>
<p>The audience is given an opportunity to observe the process involved in Portia’s father’s test for her hand in marriage. The presentation made is clear but Portia’s father presents a riddle, riddles require individuals to solve. The first thing Portia’s father’s test is, the intelligence of the individual. The Riddle seeks to evaluate the merits of each person. Clearly even from beyond the grave, her father is still seeking her best interest. Shakespeare brings to us many parent child relationships for the comparison and characteristics of the character.</p>
<p>The audience gets to witness Morroco’s process of evaluation/ judgment of the riddles. He looks at the lead he is not choosing it as it is unattractive, he looks at the Silver and thinks he is quite deserving. He looks to the gold casket and thinks it must have the picture. He thinks Portia is with of gold. We can understand his judgment. The golden casket contains a skull and a scroll and provides the wisdom. It points out Morroco’s is poor in his judgment and leaves.</p>
<p>Pay attention to shylock’s response to Jessica’s elopement and leaving of his daughter. He spends twenty of his wealth and one on his daughter. We understand the events of Shylock. Shylock must feel a sense of loss for his daughter but we must see this juxtaposition (two things please side by side for emphasis, compare and contrast) but shylock focuses on the loss of his wealth. In his second pronouncement, he refers to her as a thief, clearly this revelation of shylock’s feelings of loss do not explore his feelings of emotional loss rather it explores principally his feeling of material loss. We make certain inferences (read between the lines), and we will conclude that shylock and Jessica’s relationship lack true parental care and love opposite from Portia and her father’s and Gobbo and his son.</p>
<p>Aragon believes strongly in his deserving and is pompous and self-defeated and in the chest is a painting of a fool, he becomes a fool. Lord Bassanio will choose the lead casket. The inscription requires a husband to devote himself to Portia.</p>
<p>In act 2 we get to witness the interaction of all actual unemployed parent child relationships and the ceremony of choosing of caskets together with the father’s relationship with their child.</p>
<p>Act III</p>
<p>At the beginning, the conversation between Salano and Salerio is used by the playwright to inject new information into the plot structure. This new information will serve to pivot the entire events of the play. It will entirely alter the circumstances by which shylock will operate. This information that Antonio’s ships have been wrecked becomes the catalyst to shylock’s true nature of being corrupt, vengeful and inhumane. Shylock gets the power to be vengeful. At the end Shakespeare tells us to fulfill mercy. We must also see everyone knew of Jessica’s elopement and now they’re very jeering at shylock for his loss. They are not exactly kind to shylock. Those in Venice treated shylock unfairly.</p>
<p>Shylock is antagonistic at the movement. This scene shows the vehement hatred that shylock and the Jews show to Christians. Shylock becomes representative of the Jewish. His utterances serves to categorize all Jews and represent all Jews. While Shakespeare is pro Christian in his philosophical outlook he is still in some way sympathetic to the plight of the Jew community. In the speech from 49 to 59, shylock investigates the numerous are very potent and various unjust done to his people. In some ways the audience is encouraged to recognize his humanity and even identify with his arguments. But even though we feel his pain, shylock is motivated by vengeance. This illustrates his hateful nature. Even though we sympathize, he wants to kill someone. This hatred cannot prosper by Shakespeare. At the end shylock is given the opportunity to forgive but doesn’t. Even though Christians hated Jewish, they declined the opportunity to forgive.</p>
<p>‣</p>
<p>Shylock's speech</p>
<p>That is very deep. This is an appreciation of human nature that goes beyond religious beliefs. What he is getting at, is if someone wrongs you, do you not seek revenge. In this, Shylock asks numerous rhetorical questions (literary device, as implied answers). Look at the questions, he asks them to project his humanity, is the same way as a Christian, if you hurt me I will be hurt, can he not seek revenge too. He questions bear universal. He feels so hurt by his daughter’s betrayal, that he is driven by the urge for revenge against the only person that is in his scope for revenge, Antonio. He points to us that the same persecution (people are against you to destroy you) directed to him and his people. Isn’t it human nature to seek revenge? The same persecution directed to him will be directed back at the Christians. There is a poetic irony, he has the opportunity to return it. He will also improve on this. He is going to exact his revenge in the worst way he can think of.</p>
<p>‣</p>
<p>Tubal → Shylock</p>
<p>He launched a search not for his daughter but the wealth. The audience sees shylock’s materialistic, hateful moral composition. He doesn’t care about his daughter, he feels so much hate and anger that he wishes her death. Although she betrayed and stole from him shylock go against the nature inclination of a parent (to give everything for one child). Immediately after we empathize with Shylock’s feeling of revenge, Shakespeare shows us his nature. Shylock wants her dead. He would rather put the jewels in her coffin, Shakespeare reveals his true character, a wicked, odious, hateful man. He also remarks about the amount of money to find her. These economic loss shows his materialistic nature, he also laments that these losses are the thing that caused him pain. The audience is aghast and outraged. Shakespeare is crafting the circumstances by which we make immoral judgment based on this character.</p>
<p>Act 3 Scene II</p>
<p>It opens web Bassanio has arrived at Belmont and is proceeding to select a casket. Portia laments that if he chooses wrongly she shall lose his company forever. She also laments that she cannot in anyway influence his choice of casket yet Portia knows she is in love with Bassanio. This creates for her, a tremendous level of anxiety. The audience is made to feel the tension whether he will choose right/ wrong. Portia says nicely that in her heart she belongs to Bassanio only and so the reader empathizes with her feeling of powerlessness.</p>
<p>In that monologue (speaks to himself with others onstage) Bassanio reflex upon appearances versus reality. He looks at this from the perspective of bravery and cowardice. He says those who are brave are cowards at heart, metaphor in line 86 liver white as milk. We see him deliberate on the issue of deception. He sees golden casket as gaudy (flashy, beautiful) and deceptive with the objective of snakey. He goes to the Silver and refers to it as neither here nor there and also sees it as deceptive. He looks to the lead and refers to it as if threat rather than a promise, he understands marriage brings its challenges and so he rationalizes that the best choice is the lead casket.</p>
<p>Portia in her exchange and acceptance of the Bassanio as the winner, she gives voice to the woman’s position and condition in this society. In these times woman are not given much authority over themselves, instead men seem to take a superior position, Lord or king of woman in the society. In many of Shakespeare’s plays, the comedies he addresses issues of woman’s role in the society as well as their status in the society. The irony exists that while woman are relegated (please in an inferior position) to a lower status, it is indeed Portia, her intelligence and wit that becomes the true heroine in this play. She also gives Bassanio a token of love and fidelity, ring. She tells him and wants him to not lose the ring. This ring becomes dramatically significant (where event/ something symbolic becomes important later on in the play).</p>
<p>Bassanio professes his love for her but also says that he will never apart from the ring. Later on in the play he will give the ring to a particular lawyer as payment. Gratiano has been making amorous advances to Nerissa. He is in naughty boy. Gratiano has successfully engaged Nerissa. Both Gratiano and Bassanio succeed and is now at the same. There is a double love.</p>
<p>Salerio, Lorenzo and Jessica brings a letter, a dramatic device that reintroduced the major plot of what is happening with Antonio and shylock. We saw in scene one that Antonio’s ship is sinked. The letter pertains to that. It is by Portia’s description, we assess Bassanio’s reaction to this. His change in attitude. He was in love and joy and has entirely changed. Portia think it is a death. Bassanio is changed by what he reads.</p>
<p>The crisis in act three. We know Shakespeare has a pyramidal plot structure. The letter gives Bassanio a tremendous feeling of guilt because Antonio put himself at risk for him. He is fully well willing to sacrifice himself. We can see that Antonio is in micro parallel to the Christian ideal of self-sacrifice and according to Christ, he sacrificed himself for mankind. Shakespeare writes as a Christian. Antonio does not plead for help but tells Bassanio all debts are cleared, we have forgiveness. Antonio already accepted that the Jew will kill him. He pleads to see his friend one more time. In the letter there are many themes to cling two as a reader.</p>
<p>Act III Scene III</p>
<p>Shylock has been embittered because of his history with the Christians who has always scorned him both as an individual and as a merchant. Additionally, is that shylock still feels the sting very potently of Jessica’s betrayal, theft from him and elopement with a Christian. Because of these variables, shylock is only filled with vengeance and the issue of the bond becomes the only means by which shylock may satisfy his vengeance. Shylock does not want to hear of any justification or humanity or forgiveness because he is blinded by hate on what in his view is justice. It is fair to say that Antonio becomes the recipient shylock’s historical antagonism towards Christianity. While shylock is feeling Hurt and anger, in his view he is justified. From a Shakespearean philosophical point of view, shylock is a beast who will show no mercy or forgiveness to someone who may have wronged him. Shakespeare is Christian and is writing based on biblical matters. Shylock in his pursuit of blood goes against the basis of Christian principle. There is no forgiveness. We must see shylock’s vengeance as going against not just biblical but also about humane matters. We must still see him as a monster, he is looking for the death of someone for his vengeance. Antonio speaks from perspective that even though the bond requires his death, as an outcome of forfeiture, a contract has been made and it means that the law cannot be bent even though the outcome may seem so unjust. Antonio knows that if the law is not followed there will be a breakdown of law and the economy.</p>
<p>Antonio does not deny the course of law but we do not see him lamenting, rather he is illustrating to us is stoical disposition (look upon both good and negative with seem look), Antonio accepts that he may die, because he made the contract.</p>
<p>Antonio accepts the burden of death to save someone else. He so loves his friend, he is willing to pay the ultimate price. This puts Antonio at the level of a biblical parallel. Even though Antonio did not complain, because of love. This direct to the Messiah who died to save lives. We cannot deny the biblical scripture evidence in the play. He doesn’t care that he may die, all he wants is to see his friend one more time. The love is platonic (love someone dearly).</p>
<p>Act II Scen IV</p>
<p>We recall, woman are often times placed into inferior positions in society, we see with Portia’s father and her marriage. Her situation becomes an important thematic variable in merchant of Venice, however Shakespeare introduces dramatic irony into the play where we are aware where Portia fully intends to break the social stereo type of woman being intellectually inferior to men. This becomes an important area of consideration in Shakespeare’s social philosophy. While he is not directly saying it, he is criticizing the social norm that sees women as inferior to men. He says that it is just stupidity and goes on to illustrate how.</p>
