    <p>The world of work has changed dramatically since the twentieth century. The types of employment available have changed. People have also changed how they work. You have already learned about primary, secondary and tertiary workers. Remember, primary workers extract or harvest resources, for example farmers, fishermen, miners. Secondary workers process or manufacture products, such as factory workers or builders. Tertiary workers provide services, like doctors, teachers or advertisers.</p>
<p>In the past, there were fewer career possibilities. The opportunity to study for a professional occupation did exist, for example as a doctor/nurse, lawyer, accountant, architect or teacher. Although these occupations are still available now, there is greater choice open to young people.</p>
<p>The development of technology has created many new jobs – from computer programmers, software developers and technicians, to people who run successful businesses using digital technology, social media and the internet.</p>
<p>occupation
a type of job or the work a person does.</p>
<p>career
long-term path in a job or occupation</p>
<p>lifelong learning education
that continues over a whole lifetime</p>
<p>employed
someone who is paid to do a job by someone else.</p>
<p>employee
someone who has a job with a specific company or employer.</p>
<p>employer
someone who offers employment.</p>
<p>employment
the state of having paid</p>
<p>unemployed/unemployment
when someone does not have a job. work.</p>
<p>In the past, many people stayed in a single career for most of their lifetime. A person might get their first job with an employer and gradually work their way up in the company over many years. Today, this is very different. The average employee stays in the same job for around three to five years. People have also started to value lifelong learning. They may continue education, training, and acquiring new skills throughout their lives, which can lead to a change in career. Some people are self-employed and they hire out their time in return for payment, for example in construction or retail, while some people become entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs are people who have started up their own business – a clothes shop or an internet business, perhaps – and have taken on the challenge of building a business.</p>
<p>The twenty-first-century workplace also brings its own challenges. In some industries, new technologies can replace particular job roles. This can cause unemployment. People also live longer today than in the past, meaning that workers need to save more money for their retirement. A person who retires at age 65 may live for another 30 years or more and will need to meet their needs when retired.</p>
<p>Reasons why people work
To obtain an income
working in a job allows people to earn an income. This in turn allows them to buy goods and services that will help themselves and provide for their family’s needs. Needs are those things that are essential for everyday living, such as food, water, shelter and clothing</p>
<p>To provide for people’ wants
income from work also supports people wants – items that a person would like to have, but are not essential for everyday life or basic survival needs, such as a cell phone or fashionable shoes.</p>
<p>To attain a better standard of living
income that helps to provide for our needs and wants also helps to improve our standard of living. The more income someone has, the more opportunities they have to improve their own and their family’s lives.</p>
<p>To use our skills and qualifications
being a productive part of the wider economy provides self-esteem for the individual, as well as a sense of feeling fulfilled and reaching their potential by using their skills, knowledge and creativity</p>
<p>One other very important reason why people work is to contribute to the overall economy. They are contributing to society by applying their skills and knowledge to their job; and by paying tax they contribute money, which helps to provide goods and services the whole community needs.</p>

<p>Qualities needed for careers</p>
<p>image
Knowledge and skills
Although computers and machines can do many different kinds of work, we still need people to process resources into products, and to provide services. People bring their skills, knowledge, ideas, creativity, and experience into their work. Knowledge is what we know and learn about a particular subject, and often we are able to pass it on to someone else. For example, you might know the rules of cricket and you pass that knowledge on to someone who is just learning the game.</p>
<p>A skill is an area of expertise or the ability to carry out activities or job functions involving ideas, things and/or people. Skills are abilities (or talents) we have acquired through learning. They help us to do things well, and we develop our skills through new experiences and by practising them. In order for a country to prosper, its people need to develop their skills and knowledge so that they can carry out the work that uses their talents in the best way.</p>
<p>Qualifications
Education is the main way that a country develops its human resources. Education takes place at many levels: in the home, at school, at institutions such as colleges and universities, and in the workplace. At school, children learn the subjects set out in the national curriculum. Schools also teach skills that prepare children for life as a part of society, including communication, listening, problem-solving, cooperation, and fitting in with expectations. School may also teach values and attitudes, such as respect for rules and for their peers and elders.</p>
<p>Some of the other things to think about when choosing a career include: Needs and wants – Can the career you would like to follow provide the income you need for yourself and your family? How much are you likely to earn? Will your chosen career allow you to earn more money in the future? Potential – What do you want to do or achieve in your life? Who would you like to become? What are your dreams? Talents – What are you good at? What are your special talents? For example, are you good at working with numbers, do you have good communication or writing skills or are you a good problem solver?</p>
<p>ISSUES IN THE WORKPLACE
Sexual Harassment
any type of unwanted gesture or communication that has a sexual content. It may be:</p>
<p>a sexual advance, such as trying to kiss, hug or touch a co-worker in a sexual way</p>
<p>obscene or suggestive comments
unwanted touching, such as brushing past someone too closely
inappropriate emails, texts or phone calls
unsolicited flirting
unwanted comments such as general sexual remarks or innuendoes
Although sexual harassment mostly affects women, it is not limited to men harassing women or bosses harassing their subordinates.</p>
<p>An employer, employee, supervisor or client can harass a colleague, maybe making jokes and gestures that harass other workers.</p>
<p>The harassment may be male to female, female to male, male to male or female to female.</p>
<p>Poor Wages
workers can be exploited by big companies by being paid a lower wage.</p>
<p>Long Hours
workers can also be exploited by having to work more hours in the knowledge that the worker can be easily replaced if they do not comply.Unsafe working conditions</p>
<p>Unsafe working conditions
this can involve working in dangerous or unsafe places, having to use unguarded machinery, exposure to chemical hazards (dust, fumes, gases), noise, bad lighting, high temperatures, badly designed facilities, having to use poorly maintained equipment, lack of training to use equipment and long work hours (which can cause loss of concentration and increase the likelihood of accidents).</p>
<p>Unpunctuality of colleagues
this shows a lack of commitment to the job, lack of interest, and inability to do the job. It can lead to resentment by colleagues who do not consider someone a team player.</p>
<p>Missed deadlines
this can lead to resentment by colleagues who are always on time; missing a delivery date for a job or client is not good business practice</p>
<p>WORKPLACE RELATIONSHIPS
Friendships may grow as people work together, get to know each other and do things together outside the workplace. As they trust each other and feel a sense of connection to one another, they may share their personal or work problems more openly than in an ordinary work relationship.</p>
<p>Some work friendships develop further, into intimate relationships. Most employers discourage romantic or sexual relationships at work, as it can have damaging effects on the rest of the company.</p>
<p>Some workers get into conflicts with colleagues, and may even develop enemies. Having enemies at work can badly damage the cohesion of the group, and can reduce the job satisfaction of the people involved.</p>
