<h1><strong>Democracy</strong></h1>
<p>Trinidad and Tobago currently operates under a democratic system, allowing the entire population or all eligible members of the country to elect a government. This grants the citizens the power to control the governance of their nation.</p>
<p>‣</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Democracy</strong></p>
<p>Democracy is characterized by certain features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A constitution that safeguards citizens' rights and freedoms.</li>
<li>An independent judiciary with judges not appointed by the government.</li>
<li>Equality of all citizens under the law.</li>
<li>Voting rights for the selection of representatives.</li>
<li>Conducting free and fair elections.</li>
<li>Allowing opposition parties to criticize and challenge the government.</li>
<li>Freedom of the press.</li>
<li>Representative democracy, where citizens vote for individuals to represent them in a national assembly that creates laws. In Trinidad and Tobago, this assembly is known as the House of Representatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>The term &quot;government&quot; can refer to either the group of people who administer the country or the system by which a country is governed.</p>
<p>Most democratic countries have two houses or chambers that act as checks on each other. In Trinidad and Tobago, the second chamber is known as the Senate. These two chambers form the parliament of Trinidad and Tobago, where laws and governance are deliberated.</p>
<p>‣</p>
<p>Constitution</p>
<p>A constitution is a written document that limits the power of representatives and outlines the governance structure of a country, as well as the process for creating laws.</p>
<p>‣</p>
<p>Authoritarian Government</p>
<p>Not all countries in the world follow a democratic system. Some countries have authoritarian governments, where power is concentrated in the hands of one person or a small group.</p>
<p>‣</p>
<p>Dictatorship</p>
<p>In societies with authoritarian governments, rulers are not elected, and opposition to the government is not permitted. A country governed by a single person in an authoritarian manner is referred to as a dictatorship.</p>
<p>‣</p>
<p>Democratic vs. Authoritarian Government</p>
<p>DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>‣</p>
<p><strong>Government's Purpose</strong></p>
<p>The government plays several important roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing leadership to establish and achieve common national goals.</li>
<li>Creating, enacting, and enforcing laws to protect citizens' rights and maintain law and order.</li>
<li>Collecting taxes to fund essential services like healthcare, education, and transportation.</li>
<li>Local governments offering services such as garbage collection, drainage maintenance, and recreational facilities.</li>
<li>Engaging in negotiations and cooperation with other countries to promote trade.</li>
</ul>
<p>‣</p>
<p>Anarchy</p>
<p>Some individuals reject the idea of having a government and instead believe in anarchy, where society operates based on voluntary associations or groups without any rules or leaders. However, most people view this approach as leading to disorder and chaos.</p>
<p>‣</p>
<p><strong>Structure of the Government in Trinidad &amp; Tobago</strong></p>
<p>The government structure in Trinidad and Tobago consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Central government, including the President, the Senate, and the House of Representatives.</li>
<li>Local government bodies in cities, boroughs, and regional corporations.</li>
<li>The Tobago House of Assembly (THA), which governs Tobago.</li>
<li>Representatives are elected at all three levels of government for specific terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>‣</p>
<p><strong>Branches in the Central Government in Trinidad &amp; Tobago</strong></p>
<p>The central government in Trinidad and Tobago is divided into three branches:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Executive (Cabinet): Headed by the Prime Minister, who is responsible for overall direction and administration. The Cabinet comprises ministers chosen by the Prime Minister to oversee different ministries such as agriculture, health, and education.</li>
<li>The Legislature (Parliament): Consists of a 41-member elected House of Representatives presided over by a Speaker. Includes a 31-member Senate appointed by the President: 16 by the Prime Minister, 6 by the opposition, and 9 independent members chosen by the President.</li>
<li>The Judiciary: Composed of the Chief Justice and other judicial officials. Primarily responsible for interpreting and applying the law.</li>
</ul>
<p>‣</p>
<p><strong>Local Government</strong></p>
<p>In local government elections, citizens vote for councilors who will govern the area where they reside. Each local government has a mayor or chairman in the regional corporation.</p>
<p>‣</p>
<p>The Tobago House of Assembly (THA)</p>
<p>The THA consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>12 Assemblymen elected every four years in 12 electoral districts.</li>
<li>3 councillors appointed by the Chief Secretary and one by the minority.</li>
<li>The Chief Secretary.</li>
<li>The Executive Council.</li>
<li>The Minority Leader.</li>
<li>The Presiding Officer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The British established the Tobago House of Assembly in 1768. Initially, it comprised an upper house (the Lieutenant Governor and 12 appointed members) and a lower house (13 elected members). However, only a limited number of people were allowed to vote; they had to be Christian, English, over 21 years old, and own at least 6 acres of land.</p>
<p>By 1889, Tobago faced bankruptcy, and the sugar estate owners rioted due to the declining sugar industry (Belmanna riots). The members of the Tobago Legislature voted to abolish their elected body, handing full responsibility for the island to the British, who made Tobago a ward of Trinidad in 1899, thus becoming part of the Crown Colony.</p>
<p>‣</p>
<p>Government Functions</p>
<p>‣</p>
<p>Functions of the President</p>
<p>As the head of state, the President's functions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Officially appointing the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, and other positions based on general election results.</li>
<li>Exercising the power to withhold assent to a bill passed in Parliament if it is deemed best for the country.</li>
<li>Serving as the commander of the Trinidad and Tobago Defense Force.</li>
</ul>
<p>‣</p>
<p>Functions of Central Government</p>
<p>The central government is primarily responsible for managing the affairs of the country. Its functions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The elected House of Representatives and the appointed Senate have the power and authority to create laws for the nation.</li>
<li>Providing various services to citizens, such as public utilities (water, electricity, etc.), education, healthcare, transportation, cultural support, postal services, airport operations, immigration, international representation, security, social welfare, and the judiciary.</li>
</ul>
<p>‣</p>
<p>Functions of Local Government</p>
<p>Local governments deliver essential services to residents and workers in their respective areas. These functions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Road maintenance.</li>
<li>Drainage management.</li>
<li>Provision of truck-borne water.</li>
<li>Maintenance of local recreational facilities.</li>
<li>Garbage collection.</li>
<li>Market upkeep.</li>
<li>Management of burial and cremation sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>‣</p>
<p>Functions of the THA</p>
<p>The THA receives funding from the central government to finance and manage a wide range of services, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Education.</li>
<li>Infrastructure development.</li>
<li>Healthcare and library services.</li>
<li>Road construction and transportation.</li>
<li>Tourism initiatives.</li>
<li>Agriculture and environmental management.</li>
</ul>
<p>‣</p>
<p><strong>Systems of Government in the Caribbean</strong></p>
<p>‣</p>
<p>Constitutional Monarchy</p>
<p>Under a constitutional monarchy, the British monarch (Queen Elizabeth II) serves as the head of state, but her powers are constrained by a constitution. In the monarch's absence, a Governor General is appointed to represent her.</p>
<p>‣</p>
<p>Republic</p>
<p>In a republic, an elected executive or an appointed President assumes the role of the head of state.</p>
<p>‣</p>
<p>British Overseas Territories</p>
<p>English-speaking countries that remain dependent on Britain are referred to as British Overseas Territories, such as Anguilla, Bermuda, and the British Virgin Islands (BVI). These territories have Governors who represent the British Monarch.</p>
<p>‣</p>
<p>Part of France</p>
<p>Martinique, Guadeloupe, and French Guiana are considered full parts of France as Overseas Departments, and their residents are French citizens.</p>
<p>‣</p>
<p>Early Governments in Trinidad</p>
<p>‣</p>
<p>Spanish Government</p>
<p>In</p>
<p>1530, the Spanish appointed Antonio Sedeno as the first Governor of Trinidad. A cabildo was established to govern the island, consisting of the governor with veto power, a council comprising two magistrates and six to eight councillors, all of whom had to be of white descent. Positions were typically passed down within families.</p>
<p>‣</p>
<p>Crown Colony Government</p>
<p>Upon British colonization, Trinidad adopted a system known as Crown Colony Government. In this system, the British Government controlled Trinidad's affairs through a Governor. The first British Governor of Trinidad was Thomas Picton, who arrived with invading forces.</p>
<p>Initially, the Governor appointed a five-person Council, including high-ranking members of the local community, during the first three decades of British rule. In 1832, this council evolved into the Legislative Council.</p>
<p>The Legislative Council comprised:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 members with full government positions, such as the Chief Justice, the Colonial Treasurer, and the Protector of Slaves.</li>
<li>Another 6 members (unofficial members) appointed by the Governor from the high-ranking members of society, granting them more influence in the island's affairs.</li>
</ul>
<p>‣</p>
<p>General Elections in Trinidad &amp; Tobago</p>
<p>Central government is elected through general elections held at least once every five years. These elections determine the members of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister advises the President to dissolve Parliament, sets the election date, and declares the nomination day when candidates from different parties are nominated to contest parliamentary seats in specific areas.</p>
<p>Political parties campaign by organizing rallies, motorcades, and releasing manifestos outlining their governance plans.</p>
<p>On election day, voters cast their votes by placing an X on a ballot paper next to their preferred candidate.</p>
<p>The candidate who receives the highest number of votes becomes the member of parliament.</p>
<p>The party with the most seats wins the general election, and the leader of that party becomes the Prime Minister. This electoral system is known as first-past-the-post or a simple majority system.</p>
